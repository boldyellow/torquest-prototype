						<p>Daniel Sonshine, a Partner at TorQuest Partners, said: "We are proud to add to our portfolio another Canadian business with a long track record of entrepreneurial spirit and success. We are impressed by the achievements of Spinrite's management team &ndash; including the implementation of a best-in-class design center and marketing team, in combination with a low-cost and efficient manufacturing and distribution platform &ndash; and look forward to partnering with this industry-leading group."</p>
						<p>"Spinrite aims to provide inspirational content along with high-quality, high-value yarn products to enable the craft enthusiast to create the unique and exciting projects they desire," said Ryan Newell, CEO of Spinrite.
